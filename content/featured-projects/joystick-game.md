[Pavl G.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavl-g-420b81228/) created a Java Gradle library to control a car in a [JMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) game with an arduino joystick module connected to a Raspberry Pi4 model B, using GPIO digital pins and SPI interfacing through MCP3008 ADC (Analog~Digital Converter).

## Requirements : 
- Raspberry Pi with arm processor (pi3, pi4, piZero) with a working java8 (preferred).
- Female-to-male jumper wires.
- Breadboard.
- Arduino Joystick module.
- MCP3008 IC (ADC -- other adcs may work too, but we are covering only MCP3008 here).
- Some patience and time.

## Difference between Analog and Digital signals ? 

## What's ADC ?

## What's SPI ?
