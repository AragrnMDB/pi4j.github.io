[Pavl G.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavl-g-420b81228/) created a Java Gradle library to control a car in a 
[JMonkeyEngine](https://jmonkeyengine.org/) game with a joystick module connected to a Raspberry Pi4 model B, using
GPIO digital pins & SPI interfacing through MCP3008 ADC (Analog~Digital Converter).
