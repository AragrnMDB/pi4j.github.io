title: 'Raspberry Pi'
---

Pi4J was designed for the Raspberry Pi, so this is the only supported platform (at this moment), although the architecture of the project allows other platforms to be added.

Add this dependency to include the Raspberry Pi Platform Plugin.

```
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.pi4j</groupId>
        <artifactId>pi4j-plugin-raspberrypi</artifactId>
        <version>${pi4j.version}</version>
    </dependency>
```
