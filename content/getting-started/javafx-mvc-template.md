The FHNW University created a template project which is now part of the Pi4J example repositories.

The goal of this project is to:

* Provide a clear step-by-step how to prepare your Raspberry Pi
* Provide multiple test and start applications
* Explain the use of a MVC-model (Model-View-Controller) to clearly split data, actions and user interface
* Explain the use of JUnit test
