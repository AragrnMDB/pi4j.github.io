For this example we are going to use a [CrowPi, which is a starter kit build into a laptop-housing](https://www.elecrow.com/crowpi.html).
Of course, you can get any electronics starter kit for this purpose or buy some separate components. That's the fun of 
electronics: components are inexpensive and easy to find on ebay or one of the many web shops.
