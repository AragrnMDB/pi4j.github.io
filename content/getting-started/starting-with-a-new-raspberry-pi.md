Raspberry Pi OS is based on [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) - one of the largest 
Linux distrubutions. When running these commands regularly, you will keep 
your installation up to date for the particular major Raspberry Pi OS 
release you are using (e.g. Debian V9, aka Stretch). It will not update 
from one major release to another, for example, Stretch (V9) to Buster (V10).
