A lot of this power is based on the operating system you use. For our &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; examples we will be using the &amp;ldquo;official Raspberry Pi OS&amp;rdquo; (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Raspbian OS&amp;rdquo;) but there is a long list of other possibilities which is listed for example on the&amp;ldquo;Awesome Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; list on GitHub.
In this article we start with a brand new Raspberry Pi board.</description></item><item><title>Understanding the GPIO pins</title><link>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/understanding-the-pins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/understanding-the-pins/</guid><description>TODO info about pins, different use-cases, etc.</description></item><item><title>Java development with VSC</title><link>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</guid><description>Java on the Raspberry Pi To use Pi4J V2 you&amp;rsquo;ll need Java 11 or newer. Luckily this version is included in the current version of Raspberry Pi OS. In the release notes you can see that the version of 2019-06-20 includes OpenJDK Java 11:
2019-06-20: Based on Debian Buster Oracle Java 7 and 8 replaced with OpenJDK 11 But you will need to keep in mind this version is only compatible with ARMv7 or higher and doesn&amp;rsquo;t support all Raspberry Pi board versions.</description></item><item><title>Minimal example application</title><link>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application/</guid><description>In the &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-minimal&amp;rdquo; GitHub project you can find a project which contains the minimal code to control a digital input and output with Pi4J. The project is further described on this page. The application will toggle an LED on/off and each time you press the button, the toggling speed increases. When you have pushed the button 5 times, the application stops.
Wiring This minimal example application uses this wiring:
Building the application The main build tool used by the Pi4J project is Maven, but for this example we provided both the Maven and Gradle approach, so you can select the tool you prefer.</description></item><item><title>Introduction to electronics</title><link>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/introduction-to-electronics-with-crowpi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://v2.pi4j.com/getting-started/introduction-to-electronics-with-crowpi/</guid><description>For this example we are going to use a CrowPi, which is a starter kit build into a laptop-housing. Of course, you can get any electronics starter kit for this purpose or buy some separate components. That&amp;rsquo;s the fun of electronics: components are inexpensive and easy to find on ebay or one of the many web shops.
