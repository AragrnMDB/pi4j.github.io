! Note: if you wish to build using a Docker container, please skip ahead to the Building with Docker topic.

Ideally this would happen as part of the unit testing sequence for each code commit or at least as part of the release cycle.
To achieve this, an Arduino Due board with lots of on board I/O capability is being used.</description></item><item><title>I/O Registry</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/registry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/registry/</guid><description>An additional V2 feature is an I/O registry where all I/O instances that have been created can be maintained, managed, re-accessed, etc. As the library keeps track of all the created I/O instances, they become publicly accessible through a registry where users can interrogate, iterate, identify and access all created I/O instances that Pi4J is managing.
This is very useful for add-ons/plugins that want to provide runtime information about the state of all I/O, for example a web app illustrating the current state of I/O.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/download/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/download/install/</guid><description>This project is still in development and thus no package installers are available at this time.</description></item><item><title>Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C)</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/</guid><description>!!

By default Pi4J embeds these native libraries as resources inside the plugin&amp;rsquo;s JAR file. At runtime Pi4J extracts the native library into a temporary directory so the JVM can load the library from the filesystem. Upon termination the temporary file is automatically removed.
This automatic extration behavior works well for most users; however, there are certain edge cases where this may fail.</description></item><item><title>PiGpio</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</guid><description>Your page content goes here.</description></item><item><title>PiJukeBox by Daniel Mårtensson</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/featured-projects/pijukebox-by-daniel-martensson/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/featured-projects/pijukebox-by-daniel-martensson/</guid><description>PiJukeBox by Daniel Mårtensson Daniel used Java and Pi4J to turn an old Centrum U68 from 1940 into a MP3 player.

This scheme was incompatibility with other pin diagrams and pin numbering used by other development platforms and libraries.
As Pi4J V2 is build as a &amp;ldquo;pass thru library&amp;rdquo;, and uses PiGpio as the underlying framework, the more well-known BCM numbering is being used now.
This drawing shows the different numbers for WiringPi and BCM in a 40-pins Raspberry Pi header:</description></item><item><title>Plug-ins</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/plugins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/plugins/</guid><description>The goal of Pi4J V2 is to provide a solid base with all required &amp;ldquo;minimal functionality&amp;rdquo; while at the same time, promote third-party development and extensibility, thus enabling developers to build and maintain their extensions outside of the Pi4J core projects codebase.
This will enable us to deliver a stable, fully tested framework as the number of features inside of Pi4J can be limited and support for specific I/O hardware can be provided with an extension for Pi4J.</description></item><item><title>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/pwm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/pwm/</guid><description>The RaspberryPi hardware supports 2 hardware PWM channels.
