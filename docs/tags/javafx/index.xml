JavaFX is a framework to create user interfaces for desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile phones. JavaFX is an opensource project which is documented on openjfx.io and the sources are available in this GitHub project.
The main goal of Java has always been to be able to create applications which are &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo;. JavaFX promises the same for Graphical User Interface applications.
Gluon is the main maintainer of the OpenJFX project and offers commercial support to companies who want to use JavaFX in critical applications.</description></item><item><title>Game development with FXGL</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/fxgl/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/fxgl/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-fxgl
As described on the previous page you can use JavaFX to build user interfaces which behave exactly the same on your PC and Raspberry Pi. Let&amp;rsquo;s go a step further and make a game with an &amp;ldquo;Arcade&amp;rdquo; controller.
For this project, we will be using FXGL, an opensource library on top of JavaFX to build games.
The image of the crowpi project has every prerequisite installed to work with javaFX/FXGL</description></item><item><title>JavaFX GUI and MVC template</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/javafx-mvc-template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/javafx-mvc-template/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-template-javafx
The FHNW University created a template project which is now part of the Pi4J example repositories.
The goal of this project is to:
Provide a clear step-by-step how to prepare your Raspberry Pi Provide multiple test and start applications Explain the use of a MVC-model (Model-View-Controller) to clearly split data, actions and user interface Explain the use of JUnit test Example applications HelloFX A simple application to test if the JavaFX libraries are installed correctly.</description></item></channel></rss>
