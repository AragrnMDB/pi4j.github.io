I²C (spoken as I-Squared-C) is a bus originally invented by Philips. It is designed as a classic master-slave bus. A data transfer is always i nitiated by a master. It can also be set up in a multi-master system. I²C is connected via two signal lines (data line and clock line). The transmission rate of the bus can be between 0.1 Mbit/s up to 3.4 Mbit/s depending on the clock rate.</description></item></channel></rss>
